    "In this, we will convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values and will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City. We will use the **explore** function to get the most common restaurant in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. We will use the *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete this. Finally, We will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters and figure out the clusters with similar restaurants."
